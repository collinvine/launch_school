1. Understand the problem (inputs, outputs, and rules)
2. Set up your test cases
3. What data structures are you using
4. Describe your algorithm
5. Begin coding

# 1.1 isn't it odd

**Understand**
in: integer (positive, negative, or zero)
out: boolean (true or false)
rules:
- return true if num absolute value is odd
- else return false

# 1.2 Odd Numbers
**Understand**
in: n/a
out: log numbers 1 to 99

- inclusive of 1 and 99

# 1.3 Even Numbers
**understand**
in: n/a
out: log even numbers 1 to 99
rules
- inclusive
- only even

# 1.4 How big is the room?
**understand**

out: calculation of square meters and square feet

# 1.6 Consecutive Integers
**Understand**
in: 
- integer greater than 0
- user choice for summing or multiplying
out: the answer (sum or product) of all the numbers between 1 and the entered number


**data**
in: number is string, choice is string
loop: for? 

**algo**
- ask for user's integer
- convert to number
- ask for user's choice
- run an if statement (two functions?)
- loop over numbers and perform calculation on
- save to a variable
- print final variable

# 1.7 Short long short
**Understand**
in: function takes two strings
out: string concatenated from the two passed in
rules:
- determine the lengths
- return them as shortlongshort

**algo**
- new function that takes two arguments
- logic to check the length of the two strings
- return a new string concatenated from the passed in strings
  - short, long, short
  - no spaces

# 1.8 Leap Years pt 1
**understand**
in: function accepts one number 
out: boolean whether it is or not a leap year
rules:
- is leap year if
  - is divisible by 4
  - is not divisible by 100
  - is divisible by 400

**algo**
- simple, all true:
  - is divisible by 400? then true
    - is divisible by 100? then false
      - is divisble by 4? then true
